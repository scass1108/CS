PURPOSE:

[
  The purpose of this project was to implement Design Patterns when writing
  a program to emulate a Music Store. There were several decisions to be made:
  
  1.MusicStore.java- The datastructure we chose was a Hash Table
  that took an ArrayList of values as the values, and we used the 3 attributes individually
  each as a key. While this creates redundant data, we sacrifice space for speed when searching
  this data structure later. This is by design, it would create a better customer experience
  if their searches are faster, while the producer should worry about storage space. Also a 
  Hash table was used over a hash map because it is synchronized and we needed thread safety
  to execute populate and search later on.

  2.Results.java- The data structure in this file that we chose was Vector. We once again needed
  a synchronized data structure for thread safety since multiple threads could be trying to write to
  it at the same time. Also look up time was not an issue here, so the sacrifice of space like in MusicStore
  was not necessary.
