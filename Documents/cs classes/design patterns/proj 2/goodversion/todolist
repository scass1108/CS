Debug stuff -S

	need to add two more? when debug is 3 it does nothing, 4 too
	-Matt

Proposed debug stuff:
debug:
good	0) Nothing
good	1) Regular stdout
good	2) Constructors
good	3) Everytime value is added to the studentOrientation object (ScheduleEngineer.java)
4) ??

done		toString stuff -S
	Every class needs a toString unless there is a good reason not to. For example all the activities just print 	out their effort/cost/time 	values. This should be copy/paste after you make one.
