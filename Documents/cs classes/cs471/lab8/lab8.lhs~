Problem 1:
In homework due this morning you defined a function composeList which 
composes a list of functions into a single function.
 
    ...> composeList [ (*) 2, (*) 2] 2
    8
Redo this problem using hof. The definition should use a 'fold' and it 
   should be only be one line AND no explicit arguments (i.e. complete
   composeHOF = ?????).

> composeHOF = (\list -> foldl1 (.) list)

Problem 2: (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence )
"In mathematics, the Thue-Morse sequence, or Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence, is a 
binary sequence that begins:

  0 01 0110 01101001 0110100110010110 01101001100101101001011001101001 ...

(if your sequence starts with one..)
    1 10 1001 10010110 1001011001101001...."

...
"Characterization using bitwise negation

The Thue-Morse sequence in the form given above, as a sequence of bits, 
can be defined recursively using the operation of bitwise negation. So, the 
first element is 0. Then once the first 2n elements have been specified, 
forming a string s, then the next 2n elements must form the bitwise negation of 
s. Now we have defined the first 2n+1 elements, and we recurse.

Spelling out the first few steps in detail:

    * We start with 0.
    * The bitwise negation of 0 is 1.
    * Combining these, the first 2 elements are 01.
    * The bitwise negation of 01 is 10.
    * Combining these, the first 4 elements are 0110.
    * The bitwise negation of 0110 is 1001.
    * Combining these, the first 8 elements are 01101001.
    * And so on.
So
    * T0 = 0.
    * T1 = 01."

Define a primitive recursive function 'thue' given the nth thue sequence returns
the next thue sequence. Then once the first 2**n elements have been specified, 
forming a string s, then the next 2**n elements must form the bitwise negation 
of s. Now we have defined the first 2**(n+1) elements, and we recurse.  

For the purpose of this program we will represent these string 
as a list of 0s and 1s.

e.g.
   ...> thue [0,1,1,0]
   [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]

#
#

> thuer [] = []
> thuer (0:list) = 1 : thuer list
> thuer (1:list) = 0 : thuer list
> thue list = list ++ (thuer list)

#
#



Problem 3: Above you wrote a function. thue, to create the next "thue element".
  a) Redefine thue using 'map' instead of primitive recursion. My solution 
     was coded using (++), map, lambda expression and mod.  Call this
     function 'thueMap'. (one line of code)
  b) Define thueSeq which is a sequence of "thue elements" using the circular
     list illustrated in class for fibseq
      (http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/NOTES/HASKELL/4hF02.html)
       -- Call this function 'thueMapSeq'.  You may use thue OR thueMap in your
       definition of thueMap. (one line of code)
 
      ....> thueMap [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]
      [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]

#
#

> thueMap list = list ++ map (\i -> if i == 1 then 0 else 1) list

#
#
      ....> take 4 thueMapSeq 
      [[0],[0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]]

#
#

> thueMapSeq = [0]: [list ++ map (\i -> if i == 1 then 0 else 1) list | list <- thueMapSeq]

#
#

Problem 4.
Using an  HOF (map, fold and/or filter) define flattenT that returns a list of
value in each tuple.  

4a) not too bad
    The output should be in the same order as the values appear in the 
     original list. (one line of code if you use a lambda expression)
e.g.

   ...> flattenT  [(1,2), (3,4), (11,21),(-5,45)] 
   [1,2,3,4,11,21,-5,45]

#
#

> flattenT list = 

#
#




4b) not too bad.. 
   flattenR is the same as 10a, however, the values appear in the reverse order
   from the original list. (one line of code if you use a lambda expression)
e.g.
   ...> flattenR  [(1,2), (3,4), (11,21),(-5,45)] 
   [45,-5,21,11,4,3,2,1]

   

Problem 5:
Using a fold in your solution:

a) Define  "allTrue" to evaluate a list of expression of Bools to True if all 
   the expression in a list are true.  Provide two test cases.  Do not have an
   explicit parameters.  (i.e. allTrue = ???)



b)  define "noneTrue"  which evaluates to True if none of the boolean 
    expression in a list are true. Provide two test cases. Do not have an
    explicit argument.  (i.e. noneTrue = ???) (Hint: You should use compose to 
    "glue" some of the functions so you don't need explicit parameters.)
    



Problem 6: Write new definitions of this function:

> f = \xs -> [ x *2 - 3 | x <- xs, x > -1 ]
  
   ...> f [1,20,-3,15,2]
   [1,20,-3,15,2]


   Using explicit recursion and pattern-matching, without guards-- OR --
   using explicit recursion with guards but without pattern-matching.  You
   may use explicit arguments. (one line of code if you use a lambda expression)
   



Problem 7: (Thompson 10.13)
  Find functions f1 and f2 so that
 
   s8 =  map f1 . filter f2

  has the same effect as
 

> p8 = filter (>0) . map (+1)

 
  ....> p8 [-4,4, -3,3,12,-12]
  [5,4,13]
  (99 reductions, 153 cells)
  ....> s8 [-4,4, -3,3,12,-12]
  [5,4,13]
  (90 reductions, 137 cells)



Problem 8. 
Using higher order functions (map, fold or filter) and if necessary lambda
expressions. Write a definition for f1 and f2 so the following evaluation 
is valid:  (hint: a lambda expressions could be useful).

     f1 (f2 (*) [1,2,3,4]) 5  ~> [5,10,15,20]

     Main> f1 ( f2 (*) [1,2,3,4]) 5
     [5,10,15,20]
     (77 reductions, 123 cells)




Problem 9:  Define 'prodLtoR nums', that given a non empty list of Nums, nums,  
      the result  is a list of the prod of the numbers in nums  such that last
      value in the output is the product of all the number nums, the next to
      last value in the output is the product of all the numbers in nums 
      except the last value in nums, etc.  
      
   A) Use explicit recursion.
      You may assume the input contains at least one value.  i.e. 
            
    ...> prodLtoR [3,4,1,2,3]
    [3,12,12,24,72]
    
   B)Redo the above by filling in the blanks below.
   
     > prodLtoRHOF  = (.) reverse (foldl op [] )
     >  where
     >   op  [] y = ______________
     >   op  (x:xs) y = ___________





Problem 10:  (Thompson 17.23 )
Define the list of numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3, and 5, the
so-called Hamming numbers:


   ...> take 15 hamming
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24]


 You may consider using any combinition of the following techiques
       to express your solution  list comprehension notation, 
       and/or explicit recursion, and/or local definitions .  
       (You may find it helpful to define a "merge")
