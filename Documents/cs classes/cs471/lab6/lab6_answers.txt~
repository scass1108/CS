Part 2 

1. 	Hugs prints out 120 which is the answer to factorial of 5.
	The infered type of factorial is "factorial :: Num a => a -> a"


3.	factorial and fact2 give the same answer while fact1 gives a different answer. 
	This is because the type of fact1 is Int and the type of fact2 is Integer so 
	Int must store fewer digits than an Integer so Int must be overflowing while 
	Integer is storing the correct value.


4.	factorial (-2) gives a stack overflow since the expression is going to loop forever
	the stack runs out of memory
	factorial - 2 is literally subtracting 2 from factorial which doesnt mean anything so
	an error is output


6.	There are 5 definitions, factorial, fact1, fact2, factP, and factG
	factG returns "error neg x" since we put a check for values less than 0


7.	factorial 5.1 and factG 5.1 get a stack overflow since they will never become 0
	factG2 is set to accept Integers so since 5.1 is a floating point it doesnt accept it
	factE gives a stack overflow since there are no parentheses then the expression is 
	evaluated as (factE n) - 1 instead of factE (n - 1)	


Part 3

1. 	Lab1> prodT(2,3,4)
	24
	Lab1> prodT(2,-3,4)
	-24
	Lab1> :t prodT
	prodT :: Num a => (a,a,a) -> a


2.	Lab1> :t prodC
	prodC :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a


3.	Lab1> :t prodCx
	prodCx :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a
	
	They infer the same type but the code shows that the order of products 
	being evaluated is different


4.	It is legal and the types are:		
	prodC1 :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
	prodC2 :: Integer -> Integer
	prodC3 :: Integer
	prodC12 :: Integer -> Integer
	

5.	Lab1> prodC 1 2 3
	6
	Lab1> prodC1 2 3
	6
	Lab1> prodC2 3
	6
	Lab1> prodC3
	6
	
	None of these definitions are legal:
	prodT1 = prodT 1
	prodT2 = prodT(1)
	prodT4 = prodT(1,2)
	prodT3 = prodT(1,x,y)


6.	Left associative:  F G H = ( F  G ) H


7.	f(x) = x*5 + 3 = 5x+3
	g(x) = (3*x - 1)*2 = (3x-1)*2 = 6x-2
	
	h(x) = f(g(x)) = 5(6x-2)+3 = 30x-7
	h2(x) = g(f(x)) = 6(5x+3)-2 = 30x + 18

	h(2) = 30(2) - 7 = 53
	h2(2) = 30(2) + 18 = 78
